/* 
ðŸ‘‰ Kata
Given a string of separated numbers, remove all the negatives numbers in the string, then return an array with the max and min number.
User stories:
- The type of the items inside the array must be numbers.
- If the user tries to pass a number instead of a string to the function it 
will return "You can't use a number" string.
- It must pass all the tests.

Good Luck!
